class Questao16M {
}
 
 _____ class N {  //TOP-LEVEL class.
}

/*
 *Following options are available to fill the above blank:
	public, private, protected, final, abstract


How many above options can be used to fill above blank (separately and not together) 
such that there is no compilation error?

1, 2,3,4 ou 5 ? 

resposta:
Top-level class can use only two access modifiers [public and default(don't specify anything)]. 
private and protected cannot be used.

As file name is M.java(Questao16M), hence class N cannot be public.

Top-level class can be final, hence it is a correct option.

Top-level class can be abstract and hence it is also a correct option.
